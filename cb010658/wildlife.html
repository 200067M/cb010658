    <p1> "Sinharaja is a Rain Forest and a biodiversity hotspot which is located in south west lowland
        wet zone within Sabaragamuwa and Southern provinces of Sri lanka. Sinharaja rain forest is 
        the country's last viable area of primary tropical rain forest. It covers an area of 11.000 Ha 
        of primary and secondary forests. This narrow trip of rolling site comprises of a series of ridges
        and valleys. More than 60% of the trees are endemic to Sinharaja Forest and many of them are 
        considered rare. There is much endemic wildlife, especially birds but the reverse is also home to
        over 50% of Sri Lanka's endemic species of butterflies and mammals and also many kinds of insects,
        reptiles and rare amphibians. This is one of the main reasons that UNESCO declared Sinharaja 
        Forest as a UNESCO World Heritage in 1988 under the name of Sinharaja Forest Reserve. In 1936
        Sinharaja Forest was first recognized as being the only considerable patch of virgin tropical  
        rain forest in the island".

    <p3> "Nested in the south-eastern corner of Sri Lanka, Yala National Park is the island's principle
        national park and offers the greatest diversity of animal and bird life in the country.
        The habitats found in the park are wide-ranging from freshwater lakes to beaches, rocky outcrops
        to green plains and jungle. This creates an area of immense biodiversity and is one of the world's 
        most popular destinations to spot the elusive leopard, who love to lounge on the huge granite
        boulders that dot the parkland. Situated in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, annual rainfall for the Yala 
        region is between 900 and 1300mm depending on location, with December and January generally the wettest
        months and drought between May to September".</p3>
